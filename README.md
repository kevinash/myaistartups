**Customers**: US Olympic and Paralympic Committee, National Governing Bodies: US Figure Skating, US Wrestling, USA Surfing, US Biathlon, US Gymnastics.

**VALUATION**

2025 Valuation. Here's how it breaks down:
- **Revenue Two Years Ago**: $60,000
- **Revenue Last Year**: $200,000
- **Revenue This Year**: $300,000

Assuming a conservative revenue multiple of 5x (which is quite typical for many startups), your startupâ€™s valuation could be approximated as:

- Two Years Ago: $60,000 * 5 = $300,000
- Last Year: $200,000 * 5 = $1,000,000
- This Year: $300,000 * 5 = $1,500,000
